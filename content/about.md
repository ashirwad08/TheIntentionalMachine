# What?

This blog lives at the intersection of Data Science and Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science (and Epistemology), two duelling pursuits within me that I aim to harmonize.  

# How?

Articles on usual Data Science projects that I undertake. Articles on my academic pursuits in Epistemology and Phil. Cog. Sci. And, during times of revelation, a confluence of the two.
